# BizTalk Business Activity Monitoring Management Utility Tool
Administrators of Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) definitions use the BAM Management utility to manage and maintain all aspects of the BAM infrastructure.

You can use the BAM utility to perform the following tasks:
* Consume BAM definition and BAM configuration XML as input. The BAM definition XML or XLS files define the data to track and aggregate, as well as the business end user's view on the tracking data. The BAM configuration XML mandates where to deploy the infrastructure, such as the server name, database name, and other database settings.
* Deploy the run-time infrastructure on the server, which includes the BAM Primary Import database, BAM Star Schema database, BAM Analysis database, and corresponding Data Transformation Services (DTS) packages. The following items are created during this step:
 * BAM Primary Import database
 * BAM Star Schema database
 * BAM Archive database
 * BAM Analysis database

You can learn more about this command line tool here [BAM Management Utility Commands â€“ bm.exe](https://blog.sandro-pereira.com/2009/04/14/bam-management-utility-commands-bm-exe/). Nevertheless, this an old command line tool.

Business Activity Monitoring Management Tool is a Windows Application tool that will work on top of the BM.exe to modernize and simplify its use.
